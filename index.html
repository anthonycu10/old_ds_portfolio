		<p>Hi and welcome to my portfolio! I'm a 3rd year undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara, double majoring in Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. 
			Aside from my professional interest in the data science industry, with an emphasis on data analytics, 
			I am passionate about helping others and making a difference in my community, which has motivated me in my other pursuits such as education and mental health awareness.
		</p>
		<p>It would be a privilege to bridge my technical and analytical skills in the data analytics field, especially in storytelling and working with big data, with my passion for making an impact on others. 
			I am invested in finding solutions and playing a role in paving a better future.
		</p>

		<h4>About Me</h4>
		<p>Originally from the East Bay Area, I currently reside in the Silicon Valley.
		In my free time, I enjoy catching up with friends and family by grabbing coffee or boba. I love trying new coffee shops and am always on the lookout for new places for productivity.
		I love going on walks, creative writing & poetry, and listening to Taylor Swift. One of my favorite songs of all time would have to be "Clean (Taylor's Version)" from 1989 (Taylor's Version), of course.
		Some facts about me: I enjoy spontaneity and appreciate the use of uncommon jargon.
		</p>

		</p>
		
		<h4>Education</h4>
		<p>With over 7 years experience of tutoring elementary, middle, high school, and college students, both in-person and online, I'm complementing my double major with a minor in education with a focus on the secondary track of science and mathematics. 
		<br><br>I currently work as an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, in which I hold biweekly office hours, lead lab sections, and facilitate lectures alongside faculty to answer student questions. 
		As a ULA for <em>PSTAT 10: Principles of Data Science with R</em> for over 5 quarters now, I’ve had the opportunity to add my own insights into the course in shaping and curating course content. Some of my proudest accomplishments as a ULA have been:</span>
		<ul>
			<li>hosting a finals review session during dead week, in which I prepared PowerPoint slides and a review guide, ultimatley yielding a turnout of 50+ students in attendance</li>
			<li>creating a quiz bank database with over 7 quarters worth of past material that would be utilized in future quarters</li>
			<li>closely working with first-time coders in learning R; by encouraging and showing my care in their academic journeys, I motivated them to persevere throughout all the coding errors we faced </li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>As I strive to facilitate my students’ learning, my greatest priority as an instructor is to build rapport: I believe that a student is best able to learn in an environment where they feel comfortable enough to ask questions and make mistakes. 
		My consistent efforts in building this rapport have successfully aided me in transforming the tutor-tutee relationship into friendships, ultimately encouraging students to attend drop-in hours more regularly and become more proactive with their education.</p>

		</p>

		<h4>Mental Health</h4>
		<span>Aside from academia, I'm extremely passionate about advocating, discussing, and caring for mental health. 
			I've had the opportunity to involve myself with Lean On Me, an anonymous peer-to-peer texting service specializing in emotional support for college students across different campuses. 
			<br><br>As a supporter and executive board member for the UCSB chapter, I've practiced effective communication skills such as attentive listening, awareness, and reflection to best support service users. 
			Some accomplishments I’ve achieved on the board include:</span>
		<ul>
			<li>as the Finance Coordinator (2022-23): networked and presented to relevant organizations, successfully raising $2000+ of funding; maintained annual budget plan, managing national fees and chapter-specific payments</li>
			<li>as the Social Media Coordinator (2023-24): designed infographics announcing chapter logistics, advertising social events, and spreading awareness on various mental health topics</li>
			<li>presented at UCSB’s 2023 Mental Health Conference, discussing self-care and academic burnout </li>
			<li>led biweekly supporter meetings, interviewed and trained incoming supporters</li>
		</ul>

<!--			<p>Before entering college, I was precautioned that studying pure math would be vastly different from the number math I was used to in high school;
					 nonetheless, those expectations were met. As confusing as the Gram-Schmidt procedure or Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem could get, 
					 I still found passion in logically finding my way through a proof. 
					 I’ve intensely covered subjects such as linear algebra, topology, and real analysis, 
					 diving deep into their purely theoretical nature. 
					 However, I still missed that tangible solution that number math offered me, which invoked me to pursue statistics. 
				</p> 
				<p>The first statistics course I ever took, PSTAT 10, became the first course I was a learning assistant for, in my second year of college. 
					 Even though I felt lacking in my statistics ability, being a learning assistant boosted my confidence and allowed me 
					 the thought that I was just as capable. As I journeyed further in studying statistics and data science, 
					 I took on courses such as applied probability and statistical theory, linear regression, and machine learning. 
					 I’ve been fortunate enough that my math courses have led me to develop a better understanding and visualization of data transformation and model evaluation 
					 to supplement my pursuit of data analytics and science.
